# Plotting signals on python.

Created on July 7, 2017

## Objective 

My first task when I began working on this project with Wu-Jung Lee was:

1. Write Python code to calculate and plot the following:
    --- sinusoidal signal at 35 kHz-- time domain waveform and spectrum
    --- linear chirp signal from 65-35 kHz (downward chirp) -- time domain waveform and spectrum
    --- plot the spectrogram for both of the above signals
    --- make sure you have clear axis labels in the figures

This was one of the tasks I needed to complete by around July 5, 2017.

### Disclaimer

Since the GitHub already has the code for both plots, I will try not to copy use said code in 
this markdown file unless I feel it is necessary. 

The main purpose of this file will be describe the process I went through in trying to complete
this task. The focus will be on strategies or "solutions" which did not end up helping me 
complete this task. It will also be on problems I encountered in the coding process.
