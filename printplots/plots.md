# Plotting signals on python.

Created on July 7, 2017

## Objective 

My first task when I began working on this project with Wu-Jung Lee was:

1. Write Python code to calculate and plot the following:
    --- sinusoidal signal at 35 kHz-- time domain waveform and spectrum
    --- linear chirp signal from 65-35 kHz (downward chirp) -- time domain waveform and spectrum
    --- plot the spectrogram for both of the above signals
    --- make sure you have clear axis labels in the figures

This was one of the tasks I needed to complete by around July 5, 2017.

### Disclaimer

Since the GitHub already has the code for both plots, I will try not to copy said code in 
this markdown file unless I feel it is necessary.
